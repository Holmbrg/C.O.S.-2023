# Crypto-Trading-Opportunities
This script scans a list of cryptocurrency symbols to identify potential trading opportunities based on specific technical indicators. It fetches real-time data from the TAAPI.io API and Binance API, processes the 
indicators, and outputs any findings directly to the console. Designed to help save time when day trading. This code does not offer the perfect trading strategy, as such a strategy cannot be public,
this code is only designed to help look at certain indicators and tell the user where there MIGHT be an opportunity for trading compared to many other tokens. This saves time, as you do not have to look through
hundreds of tokens to find a potential trading opportunity on the short term. With this said, the author of this code, or anyone who might modify the code, are not responsible for any trading losses the user might have.
It is always important to do your own research, this is mearly a tool (which you can also modify to your liking) to help do something that would normally take longer doing yourself.

The name of the python program comes from the fact that it filters through crypto tokens and finds opportunities.
The code itself, is around 1 year old as of this update (3. October 2024). So there might be bugs, specifically since TAAPI could have updated their API, and Bitget could have changed there source code. If you find any bugs, feel free to reach out.

Features

    Fetches RSI, EMA (200), and Stoch RSI indicators for each symbol.
    Calculates the EMA 200 Kvotient to assess price movements relative to the EMA.
    Checks predefined conditions to identify potential trading opportunities.
    Outputs opportunities directly to the console for immediate awareness.
    Processes a comprehensive list of cryptocurrency symbols in a continuous loop.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.6+: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Required Python Libraries:
        requests
        typing (part of the standard library in Python 3.5+)

Installing Dependencies:

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

Bash:
pip install requests


Setup

    Clone or Download the Script:

    Save the script code to a file named crypto_analysis.py.

    Obtain a TAAPI.io API Key:
        Sign up at TAAPI.io to get your API key.
        Note the API rate limits associated with your plan.

    Replace the API Key in the Script:

    In crypto_analysis.py, replace "YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY" with your actual TAAPI.io API key:

    python

    TAAPI_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY"

    Adjust Rate Limits if Necessary:
        Modify the time.sleep(1) value in the main() function based on your API plan's rate limits.
        Ensure compliance with both TAAPI.io and Binance API rate limits.

Usage

Run the script using the command line:

bash:

python crypto_analysis.py

The script will:

    Continuously loop through the list of symbols.
    Fetch indicator data and current prices.
    Process the data to check for trading opportunities based on specified conditions.
    Print any opportunities found to the console.
    After completing the list, it restarts the process.

Customization

    Modify the Symbol List:

    You can edit the symbols list in the main() function to add or remove cryptocurrency symbols as needed.

    python

symbols = ["BTC", "ETH", "XRP", ...]  # Add or remove symbols as desired, though, the symbols have to be reqognized according to TAAPI as used.

Adjust Trading Conditions:

If you wish to change the logic for identifying trading opportunities, modify the conditions in the process_data() function.

python:

    def process_data(symbol: str, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        # Modify or add conditions here

Important Notes

    API Rate Limits:
        Be mindful of the rate limits for both TAAPI.io and Binance APIs.
        Excessive requests may lead to being temporarily blocked or incurring additional charges.

    Error Handling:
        The script includes basic error handling for network requests and missing data.
        If a symbol causes an error, the script will print an error message and continue with the next symbol.

    Data Accuracy:
        The indicators and prices are fetched in real-time but may still be subject to delays or inaccuracies.
        Always verify the information before making trading decisions.

    Security:
        Keep your TAAPI.io API key confidential.
        Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control systems like Git if the repository is public.

Troubleshooting

    Module Not Found Error:

    If you encounter an error stating a module is not found, ensure all dependencies are installed:

    bash

    pip install requests

    Invalid API Key Error:

    If the API responds with an authentication error, double-check that you've correctly replaced "YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY" with your valid TAAPI.io API key.

    Symbol Not Supported:

    If a symbol isn't supported by the APIs, the script will print an error message. You may need to verify the symbol's availability on Binance Futures or adjust the symbol format.
